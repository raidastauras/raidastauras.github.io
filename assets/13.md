ID-Mask lets you prove stuff about yourself like your age or nationality without revealing who you are. It runs almost entirely on the client side, pulls your ID data using Smart-ID (Baltics only), and generates zero-knowledge proofs on the client side. These proofs are cryptographic receipts that basically say 'yes, this fact is true' without leaking anything else. Proofs can be shown via QR code, stored in Google / Apple wallet.

Here’s the clever bit: we've combined zero-knowledge proofs and passkeys to *bind a json to a person*. To prevent proof sharing (like faking being 21 with your older brother’s proof), each proof is bound to a passkey. When presenting it, you use your device to signs a challenge proving the proof really belongs to you.
