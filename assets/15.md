I prefer staying active and working toward hard goals over settling into comfort. Struggling through challenges feels more worthwhile than taking it easy. Success hits different when you’ve worked for it. Failure is frustrating, but it’s part of the deal.

I value capitalism and free markets and have disdain for bureaucracy and slow-paced systems. If we settle for a slow-paced life, living off past achievements, history will move on without us. I'd rather stay focused on pursuing challenging, impactful goals instead of settling down.

There are people and countries out there relentlessly working and innovating, even if their standards of living haven’t yet reached ours. In all fairness, they deserve more credit because they’re constantly striving, while some Europeans are living off the hard work of previous generations.

This is how history moves — progress is often followed by complacency and comfort. Countries go through these cycles. But I’d rather be part of the progress cycle, where there is work to be done, than live in a stage where everything is already been achieved, and all that is left is to enjoy life and wait for a slow decline. Prioritizing future growth over complacency in the present. Investing in progress rather than relying on current resources.
