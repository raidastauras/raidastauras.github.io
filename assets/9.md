#### **Blockchain space is exciting because:**
1. increase of efficiency of storing public data, i.e. DIDs, SBTs etc.
2. zero knowledge proofs (the tools to offload compute to the client side)
3. smart contracts sitting on chain are awesome and super interesting
4. relentless innovation

#### **So far I've:**

| <div align="center">**web2 vs web3** <p>⚔️</p> </div> | explored the difference between [web2 and web3 app backends](https://web2vsweb3-snowy.vercel.app/) from the dev perspective |
| <div align="center">**zkApp program winner** <p>🏆</p> </div> | done some zk-app building on Mina protocol (snarkyjs) and made a [basic zero knowledge proof explanation](https://zkapp-ui.vercel.app/). With it, was selected as one of the 7 winners of Mina zkApps beta testers program 🤗! |
| <div align="center">**Github zkApp** <p>📜</p> </div> | created [zk-app](http://zk-mina-github.vercel.app/) that allows prooving that Mina account is held by a Gihub user. Will be working on improving the app and expanding it's logic further 🤗! |
