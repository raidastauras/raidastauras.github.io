When light shines into a liquid, some of it is absorbed by the materials and molecules inside. For example, if you shine light into a liquid with fat molecules, some of the light at wavelengths around ~2310 nm will be absorbed. The chart below shows the light absorption of cow milk, illustrating how fat molecules in the milk absorb light in that range!

But is it only fat molecules we can detect, or are there other patterns we could use to, say, check if a cow is sick, pregnant, or just having a good or bad day? It looks like all of this is possible; we just need to use machine learning to teach models to predict these variables. This is a perfect case for serious data processing, feeding it to RNNs/LSTMs to predict various labels.

Some aspects that I am still wrapping my head around:

1. **The complexity of the hardware needed to make this work.** It starts with growing a crystal with specific atom arrangements, then using it to make a laser chip. This chip is then embedded into a small device with a light source, lenses, tubes for the liquid to flow through, and a computer chip to collect and process the data (1000 laser readings per second). Even once you have the hardware, cow environments aren't exactly lab-like, so constant monitoring and maintenance of the devices are required. Plus, we have to consider the gravitational forces that could affect the light's path ðŸ¤¯.

2. **The potential of this technology to help with our health.** If it works with animals, maybe one day we could implant a tiny laser chip under our skin to shine light into our blood and gather real-time health data. We could use machine learning to interpret this data and provide daily health summariesâ€”like risks, possible diseases, nutrition deficiencies, and alerts for any anomalies. But before that, there are huge challenges like GDPR and other regulations. Fortunately, cows aren't concerned about such things, and theyâ€™re happy to let us help them with insights.
